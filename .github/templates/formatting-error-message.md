You can do one of the following things to solve the issue, feel free to choose based on which one is more convenient for you:

- run `npm run format:fix` locally and commit the changes
- if you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), open the files with the errors, open the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_command-palette) and run the `Format Document` command

#### Frequently Asked Questions ❔

<details>
<summary>Why do I see this message?</summary>

We use a formatter for our source code, called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). For each PR we run this formatter as part of a CI job to make sure every file is formatted with it. You see this message, because one of the files in this PR's branch is not formatted.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why do we use a formatter?</summary>

You can read a lot of articles on the internet about why having a code formatter is beneficial. Probably the best place to start is prettier's own website: [prettier - why-prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/why-prettier).

Here are some quotes from the website:

> “We want to free mental threads and end discussions around style. While sometimes fruitful, these discussions are for the most part wasteful.”

> “Our top reason was to stop wasting our time debating style nits.”

> “I want to write code. Not spend cycles on formatting.”

<summary>One of the files with formatting issues is autogenerated. What should I do?</summary>

You have a few options:

- if you have access to the code generator's source code, you could use the [Prettier API](https://prettier.io/docs/en/api) as part of the code generation process. This is similar to what people using [graphql codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/other/add) do for example
- if you can't change the code generation's process to call prettier as part of it, you can add a glob pattern to the `.prettierignore` file, which is located at the root of the repository.

<details>
<summary>The reported error is in a file I haven't touched. What should I do?</summary>

Someone might have bypassed the branch protection rules, and committed an unformatted file to master. The best you can do is to create a new PR with only the formatting changes, and notify everyone else in the [slack channel]() about it. After that PR gets merged, you can merge master into this PR, and the formatting errors will be solved.

<details>
<summary>Can this formatting be done automatically by my IDE?</summary>

Of course! If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and then reload your IDE. You might also want to read [the documentation about how to install every recommended extension]().

After that, VSCode will use prettier as the default formatter. See how formatting works in vscode by vitising their website: [vscode - formatting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting).

We also recommend you to enable formatting on file saves by adding the following configuration to your [user's setting.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings):

```jsonc
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  // format on paste can be annoying, feel free to disable or enable it.
  "editor.formatOnPaste": false
}
```
