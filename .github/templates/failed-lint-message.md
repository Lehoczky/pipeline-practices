#### Frequently Asked Questions ❔

<details>
  <summary>Why do I see this message?</summary>

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as our JavaScript [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29), and run it as part of CI workflow for each PR. It found some errors in this PR's branch.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>One of the files with lint errors is autogenerated. What should I do?</summary>

You have a few options:

- if you want to ignore the errors and you can access the code generator's source or configuration, you can add an `/* eslint-disable */` comment to the top of the file. This is what [unplugin/unplugin-auto-import](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-auto-import/blob/main/test/__snapshots__/dts.test.ts.snap) or [graphql codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/other/add) do for example
- if you want to ignore the errors, but cant change the file output, you should find the `.eslintignore` file at the root of the repository and write a globe pattern to ignore this (and potentially other, new) generated file
- if you want to fix the errors and can access the code generator's source, you could use the [ESLint API](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/integrate/nodejs-api) as part of the generation process to fix the issues.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>The reported error is in a file I haven't touched. What should I do?</summary>

Someone might have bypassed the branch protection rules, and committed a file with lint errors to master. The best you can do is to create a new PR with only the lint fixes, and notify everyone else in the [slack channel]() about it. After that PR gets merged, you can merge master into this PR, and the lint errors will be solved.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>I didn't see these errors in my IDE, is there a way to see them there?</summary>

Of course! If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and then reload your IDE. You might also want to read [the documentation about how to install every recommended extension]().
If you still can't see the lint errors in the IDE, contact **Zoltan Lehoczky**, and he will help:)

You can also add the following configuration to your [user's setting.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) file, to auto-fix errors on save:

```json
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>I think one of the rules should be turned off, because it doesn't make sense to use it. Who should I contact?</summary>

You can suggest turning a rule off in the [#frontend]() channel. Make sure to describe your arguments against the rules, and link other sources with the information if you can:)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>I think this message can be improved. Who should I tell my ideas?</summary>

You can post your improvement idea in the [#frontend]() channel, we will make sure to respond, and take your suggestions seriously;)
